Staking dApp for proof of concept should be compatible with 

https://etherscan.io/address/0x54616c0815c306fc22417b96282ca4aa6f47d357#writeContract

and then also with 

https://etherscan.io/address/0xac3ca81dfac18f2f3b11399bc1d419ee318d7f3f


goal is to be able to adapt the staking dApp to any NFT smart contract.
